Diego Chavarro

This script calculates diversity measures as in Rafols, i. and Meyer, M. (2010). Diversity and network coherence as indicators of interdisciplinarity: case studies in bionanoscience. Scientometrics, 82 (2), p.p. 263-287. doi:10.1007/s11192-009-0041-y

The instrucions are:

-Download all the files and keep them in the same directory.
In the file diversity_measures_1.R, replace the path with your working directory, which is the directory in which
you keep the script files.

-you can edit the file articles_sample.csv to analyze your own sample. This file is a set of paper identified by a number in the first column and ISI subject categories that the paper references. 

-Install r
-Invoke r by typing R in the command line
-Then, type source("C:\\path\\to\\the\\file\\diversity_measures_1.R"), assuming you are on a windows machine. 

After running the script, there should be a series of files in the
directory. Check results.txt for the calculations.
